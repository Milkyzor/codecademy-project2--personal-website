            <h3>Ricardo Rocheta</h3>
            <h3>29 Years Old</h3>
            <h3>Algarve, Portugal</h3>
          </div>

          <div id="bioTextContent">
            <h4>The Early Years: A Curious Mind in Motion</h4>
            <p>
              Since I was in diapers, curiosity was my middle name, just ask my
              mom! My childhood was a whirlwind of sports, from rugby tackles to
              trampoline flips, surfing waves to skateboarding tricks. These
              weren't just hobbies, they were my first life coaches, teaching me
              about dedication, teamwork, and the art of a graceful fall.
            </p>

            <h4>The Leap of Independence</h4>
            <p>
              At 18, armed with dreams and a suitcase, I left my nest to find my
              own sky. This quest led me to beach jobs that weren't just jobs;
              they were chapters in a novel of self-discovery. Lifeguarding,
              beach maintenance, and bartending. Each role was a new scene, a
              new character to play.
            </p>

            <h4>London Calling: Shaken, Not Stirred</h4>
            <p>
              Then came London, the city of dreams and drizzle. Here, I mixed
              drinks and experiences, starting as a bartender and stirring my
              way up to bar supervisor. This wasn't just about cocktails, it was
              about people, stories, and the magic that happens when both mix.
            </p>

            <h4>Homecoming and New Horizons</h4>
            <p>
              Life took a U-turn back to Portugal, where I embraced a sales
              role, dealing with the finer things in life: wines, spirits,
              cigars, and gourmet foods. This wasn't just sales, it was a
              masterclass in taste, luxury, and the art of negotiation.
            </p>

            <h4>The Modelling Sidestep</h4>
            <p>
              Simultaneously, while selling fine wines, I stepped into the world
              of modeling and production assistant. This unexpected venture led
              me to appear in commercials and a Netflix series. It was a
              thrilling detour that showcased my adaptability and willingness to
              embrace new experiences.
            </p>

            <h4>The COVID Curveball</h4>
            <p>
              As COVID reshaped the world, it redirected my path to construction
              sites. Amidst a global pause, I was hands-on, building a house and
              a pool. This period wasn't just about physical building, it was
              about developing resilience and adaptability in uncertain times.
            </p>

            <h4>Back to Normality:</h4>
            <p>
              As things started getting back to normal, I took over managing a
              bar in Quinta do Lago. But, you know, the night owl life isn't for
              everyone. I felt like Batman, minus the cape and the cool gadgets.
              So, back to sales I went, first in telecom, then in a vacation
              rental tech company.
            </p>

            <h4>Tech Awakening</h4>
            <p>
              Amidst all this, a spark was lit, a fascination with web
              development. Surrounded by developer friends and tech talks, I
              dove headfirst into coding. This wasn't just a hobby, it was a
              calling. I even built a self-balancing board, a testament to my
              love for challenges and problem-solving.
            </p>

            <h4>Today: A Coder with a Story</h4>
            <p>
              Now, here I am, a sales expert by day, a coding enthusiast by
              night, and a lifelong learner always. My life is a tapestry of
              experiences, each thread woven with passion, curiosity, and a dash
              of humor.
            </p>

            <h4>What Drives Me?</h4>
            <p>
              I'm driven by the quest to understand the "Why?" behind
              everything. Challenges? Bring them on. I thrive on efficiency and
              solving puzzles. My world orbits around my family, friends, good
              food, and fine wine. Onewheel is my zen, F1 and MotoGP my Sunday
              sermons, and the great outdoors my playground.
            </p>
