            <h4>The Early Years: A Curious Mind in Motion</h4>
            <p>
              Since I was in diapers, curiosity was my middle name, just ask my
              mom! My childhood was a whirlwind of sports, from rugby tackles to
              trampoline flips, surfing waves to skateboarding tricks. These
              weren't just hobbies, they were my first life coaches, teaching me
              about dedication, teamwork, and the art of a graceful fall.
            </p>

            <h4>The Leap of Independence</h4>
            <p>
              At 18, armed with dreams and a suitcase, I left my nest to find my
              own sky. This quest led me to beach jobs that weren't just jobs;
              they were chapters in a novel of self-discovery. Lifeguarding,
              beach maintenance, and bartending. Each role was a new scene, a
              new character to play.
            </p>

            <h4>London Calling: Shaken, Not Stirred</h4>
            <p>
              Then came London, the city of dreams and drizzle. Here, I mixed
              drinks and experiences, starting as a bartender and stirring my
              way up to bar supervisor. This wasn't just about cocktails, it was
              about people, stories, and the magic that happens when both mix.
            </p>

            <h4>Homecoming and New Horizons</h4>
            <p>
              Life took a U-turn back to Portugal, where I embraced a sales
              role, dealing with the finer things in life: wines, spirits,
              cigars, and gourmet foods. This wasn't just sales, it was a
              masterclass in taste, luxury, and the art of negotiation.
            </p>

            <h4>The Modelling Sidestep</h4>
            <p>
              Simultaneously, while selling fine wines, I stepped into the world
              of modeling and production assistant. This unexpected venture led
              me to appear in commercials and a Netflix series. It was a
              thrilling detour that showcased my adaptability and willingness to
              embrace new experiences.
            </p>

            <h4>The COVID Curveball</h4>
            <p>
              As COVID reshaped the world, it redirected my path to construction
              sites. Amidst a global pause, I was hands-on, building a house and
              a pool. This period wasn't just about physical building, it was
              about developing resilience and adaptability in uncertain times.
            </p>

            <h4>Back to Normality:</h4>
            <p>
              As things started getting back to normal, I took over managing a
              bar in Quinta do Lago. But, you know, the night owl life isn't for
              everyone. I felt like Batman, minus the cape and the cool gadgets.
              So, back to sales I went, first in telecom, then in a vacation
              rental tech company.
            </p>

            <h4>Tech Awakening</h4>
            <p>
              Amidst all this, a spark was lit, a fascination with web
              development. Surrounded by developer friends and tech talks, I
              dove headfirst into coding. This wasn't just a hobby, it was a
              calling. I even built a self-balancing board, a testament to my
              love for challenges and problem-solving.
            </p>

            <h4>Today: A Coder with a Story</h4>
            <p>
              Now, here I am, a sales expert by day, a coding enthusiast by
              night, and a lifelong learner always. My life is a tapestry of
              experiences, each thread woven with passion, curiosity, and a dash
              of humor.
            </p>

            <h4>What Drives Me?</h4>
            <p>
              I'm driven by the quest to understand the "Why?" behind
              everything. Challenges? Bring them on. I thrive on efficiency and
              solving puzzles. My world orbits around my family, friends, good
              food, and fine wine. Onewheel is my zen, F1 and MotoGP my Sunday
              sermons, and the great outdoors my playground.
            </p>

            <h5>
              So, if you're looking for someone who's as passionate about coding
              as they are about life, you've found your guy. Let's connect and
              create something amazing together!

          <h3>FunWheel:</h3>
          <!-- Add images and Videos -->
          <h4>Why I Built It:</h4>
          <p>
            The inspiration for building my own FunWheel struck after
            experiencing the exhilarating mix of snowboarding, surfing, and
            skating on a friend's Onewheel. However, the steep price of nearly
            3000€ for a new Onewheel spurred me to explore a DIY approach.
          </p>

          <h4>The Journey Begins:</h4>
          <p>
            My project started with a YouTube tutorial on constructing a budget
            version of the Onewheel. However, knowing my aspirations for quality
            and performance, I decided to skip the preliminary step and dive
            straight into building a high-grade FunWheel.
          </p>

          <h4>The Process:</h4>
          <p>
            The journey involved extensive research and community engagement,
            leading to a comprehensive parts list and a detailed research plan.
            The key steps included creating a battery scheme, consulting with
            electronics engineers, assembling the battery, and integrating the
            footpad sensor, battery, and motor hub with the speed controller.
            Calibration and fine-tuning followed, ensuring the board performed
            to my expectations. This endeavor spanned approximately three
            months, from conception to the joy of riding my creation.
          </p>

          <h4>Challenges Overcome:</h4>
          <p>
            The uncertainty of successful execution was a significant challenge,
            but it didn't deter my determination. Building the battery was
            daunting yet manageable.
          </p>

          <h4>A Memorable Highlight:</h4>
          <p>
            About a month after completing my board, I participated in the
            Onewheel Algarve Event in Portugal, an unforgettable adventure. This
            300km journey across the Algarve, from Vila Real de Santo António to
            the Sagres lighthouse, took us four days. We rode on beaches, along
            cliffs, through mountains, across cities, in skateparks, a bit of
            everything. Starting each day early in the morning and finishing in
            the evening, the event brought together around 60 riders from over
            20 nationalities. This diverse and exhilarating experience, riding
            the FunWheel I built, stands out as one of the most thrilling and
            fulfilling episodes of my life.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- My personal website -->
        <div id="myPersonalWebsite">
          <h3>My Personal Website:</h3>
          <h4>Why I Built This Website:</h4>
          <p>
            My journey began with a simple exercise from Codecademy, but my
            passion for challenges and eagerness to apply what I had learned
            inspired me to elevate the project. I aimed to create an interactive
            website that not only showcases my coding skills but also provides
            an in-depth view of my life, experiences, and work. A combination of
            a portfolio and an interactive CV.
          </p>

          <h4>How I Achieved It:</h4>
          <p>
            The process started with visualizing the concept, then breaking it
            down into manageable tasks, and prioritizing them. I created a guide
            outlining the website's functionalities to stay focused amidst the
            vast possibilities of coding. Throughout the development, ChatGPT
            was a crucial resource for clarifying doubts and correcting code.
            Every line of this website was written by me, with ChatGPT aiding in
            understanding concepts rather than doing the coding. After
            completion, I sought feedback from developer friends to refine my
            skills and avoid potential bad habits.
          </p>

          <h4>Challenges Encountered:</h4>
          <p></p>

          <h4>What were the biggest challenges?</h4>
          <p>
            Designing the animations was a delightful challenge. My enthusiasm
            for the project meant I often found myself happily immersed in the
            work, losing track of time as I enjoyed every moment of the creative
            process.
          </p>

          <h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
          <p>
            This is the result of 1 month and half of lessons in Codecademy and
            tons of motiviation to change careers to Web Development.
