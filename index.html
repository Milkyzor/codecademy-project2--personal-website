            <h4>The Early Years: A Curious Mind in Motion</h4>
            <p>
              Since I was in diapers, curiosity was my middle name, just ask my
              mom! My childhood and teenage years were a whirlwind of sports,
              from rugby tackles to trampoline flips, surfing waves to
              skateboarding tricks. These weren't just hobbies, they were my
              first life coaches, teaching me about dedication, teamwork, and
              the art of a graceful fall.
            </p>

            <h4>The Leap of Independence</h4>
            <p>
              At 18, armed with dreams and a suitcase, I left my nest to find my
              own sky. This quest led me to beach jobs that weren't just jobs,
              they were chapters in a novel of self-discovery. Lifeguarding,
              beach maintenance, and bartending. Each role was a new scene, a
              new character to play.
            </p>

            <h4>London Calling: Shaken, Not Stirred</h4>
            <p>
              Then came London, the city of dreams and drizzle. Here, I mixed
              drinks and experiences, starting as a bartender and stirring my
              way up to bar supervisor. This wasn't just about cocktails, it was
              about people, stories, and the magic that happens when both mix.
            </p>

            <h4>Familiar Lands and Horizons Expanded</h4>
            <p>
              Returning to Portugal, I was part of the opening team for The
              Cheeky Pup in Quinta do Lago, the best bar in the area. After a
              bustling high season, I embarked on a life-changing journey to
              Southeast Asia with my girlfriend, with no return ticket in hand.
              This trip was undoubtedly one of the best experiences of our
              lives, cut short only due to family setbacks that necessitated our
              return.
            </p>

            <h4>Turning the Page: A Fresh Start in Sales</h4>
            <p>
              After these adventures I transitioned into a sales role back in
              Portugal, immersing myself in the world of fine wines, spirits,
              cigars, and gourmet foods. This wasn't just sales; it was a
              masterclass in taste, luxury, and the art of negotiation.
            </p>

            <h4>The Modelling Sidestep</h4>
            <p>
              Simultaneously, while selling fine wines, I stepped into the world
              of modeling and production assistant. This unexpected venture led
              me to appear in commercials and a Netflix series. It was a
              thrilling detour that showcased my adaptability and willingness to
              embrace new experiences.
            </p>

            <h4>The COVID Curveball</h4>
            <p>
              As COVID reshaped the world, it redirected my path to construction
              sites. Amidst a global pause, I was hands-on, building a house and
              a pool. This period wasn't just about physical building, it was
              about developing resilience and adaptability in uncertain times.
            </p>

            <h4>Back to Normality</h4>
            <p>
              As things started getting back to normal, I took over managing a
              bar in Quinta do Lago. But, you know, the night owl life isn't for
              everyone. I felt like Batman, minus the cape and the cool gadgets.
              So, back to sales I went, first in telecom, then in a vacation
              rental tech company.
            </p>

            <h4>Tech Awakening</h4>
            <p>
              Amidst all this, a spark was lit, a fascination with web
              development. Surrounded by developer friends and tech talks, I
              dove headfirst into coding. This wasn't just a hobby, it was a
              calling. I even built a self-balancing board, a testament to my
              love for challenges and problem-solving.
            </p>

            <h4>Today: A Coder with a Story</h4>
            <p>
              Now, here I am, a sales expert by day, a coding enthusiast by
              night, and a lifelong learner always. My journey is a mosaic of
              adventures, each piece crafted with passion, curiosity, and a
              sprinkle of humor.
            </p>

            <h4>What Drives Me?</h4>
            <p>
              I'm driven by the quest to understand the "Why?" behind
              everything. Challenges? Bring them on. I thrive on efficiency and
              problem solving. My world orbits around my family, friends, good
              food, and fine wine. Onewheel is my zen, F1 and MotoGP my Sunday
              sermons, and the great outdoors my playground.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, if you're looking for someone who's as passionate about coding
              as they are about life, you've found your guy. Let's connect and
              create something amazing together!

            <!-- Add images and Videos -->
            <h4>Why I Built It:</h4>
            <p>
              The inspiration for building my own FunWheel struck after
              experiencing the exhilarating mix of snowboarding, surfing, and
              skating on a friend's Onewheel. However, the steep price of nearly
              3000€ for a new Onewheel spurred me to explore a DIY approach.
            </p>

            <h4>The Journey Begins:</h4>
            <p>
              My project started with a YouTube tutorial on constructing a
              budget version of the Onewheel. However, knowing my aspirations
              for quality and performance, I decided to skip the preliminary
              step and dive straight into building a high-grade FunWheel.
            </p>

            <h4>The Process:</h4>
            <p>
              The journey involved extensive research and community engagement,
              leading to a comprehensive parts list and a detailed research
              plan. The key steps included creating a battery scheme, consulting
              with electronics engineers, assembling the battery, and
              integrating the footpad sensor, battery, and motor hub with the
              speed controller. Calibration and fine-tuning followed, ensuring
              the board performed to my expectations. This endeavor spanned
              approximately three months, from conception to the joy of riding
              my creation.
            </p>

            <h4>Challenges Overcome:</h4>
            <p>
              The uncertainty of successful execution was a significant
              challenge, but it didn't deter my determination. Building the
              battery was daunting yet manageable.
            </p>

            <h4>A Memorable Highlight:</h4>
            <p>
              About a month after completing my board, I participated in the
              Onewheel Algarve Event in Portugal, an unforgettable adventure.
              This 300km journey across the Algarve, from Vila Real de Santo
              António to the Sagres lighthouse, took us four days. We rode on
              beaches, along cliffs, through mountains, across cities, in
              skateparks, a bit of everything. Starting each day early in the
              morning and finishing in the evening, the event brought together
              around 60 riders from over 20 nationalities. This diverse and
              exhilarating experience, riding the FunWheel I built, stands out
              as one of the most thrilling and fulfilling episodes of my life.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- My personal website -->
          <div id="myPersonalWebsite">
            <h3>My Personal Website:</h3>
            <h4>Why I Built This Website:</h4>
            <p>
              My journey began with a simple exercise from Codecademy, but my
              passion for challenges and eagerness to apply what I had learned
              inspired me to elevate the project. I aimed to create an
              interactive website that not only showcases my coding skills but
              also provides an in-depth view of my life, experiences, and work.
              A combination of a portfolio and an interactive CV.
            </p>

            <h4>How I Achieved It:</h4>
            <p>
              The process started with visualizing the concept, then breaking it
              down into manageable tasks, and prioritizing them. I created a
              guide outlining the website's functionalities to stay focused
              amidst the vast possibilities of coding. Throughout the
              development, ChatGPT was a crucial resource for clarifying doubts
              and correcting code. Every line of this website was written by me,
              with ChatGPT aiding in understanding concepts rather than doing
              the coding. After completion, I sought feedback from developer
              friends to refine my skills and avoid potential bad habits.

            <h4>Challenges Encountered:</h4>
            <p></p>

            <h4>What were the biggest challenges?</h4>
            <p>
              Designing the animations was a delightful challenge. My enthusiasm
              for the project meant I often found myself happily immersed in the
              work, losing track of time as I enjoyed every moment of the
              creative process.
            </p>

            <h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
            <p>
              This is the result of 1 month and half of lessons in Codecademy
              and tons of motiviation to change careers to Web Development.
