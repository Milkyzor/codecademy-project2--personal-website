# Ricardo Rocheta's Personal Website

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal website project! This website goes beyond what I was asked to do for my 2nd Codecademy off-platform project. The complexity and depth of this project reflect my enthusiasm and dedication to learning and applying web development skills. Check out the live site [here](https://priceless-kepler-06d70c.netlify.app/).

### Important Note:

Please ensure that you open the website in the intended orientation. If you start in portrait mode, continue using portrait, and similarly for landscape mode.

## Project Insights

### Key Takeaways

This project has been a significant learning curve for me. Here are some key insights:

- **Responsive Design**: I learned the importance of using @media queries for different screen sizes. This approach is more efficient than using JavaScript functions to check screen orientation.
- **Development Approach**: Building elements of the page for different screen sizes as I develop the website, rather than after completing the entire site, especially when dealing with animations.
- **Handling Animations**: Animations add a nice touch but can be challenging to manage with different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Architecture Over Flexibility**: I realized that building two separate sites (one for each orientation) instead of a single fully responsive site can lead to complications. In future projects, I'll focus more on the architecture of the site rather than improvising as I go.

### Project Structure

The project is structured with separate stylesheets for landscape and portrait orientations to cater to different viewing experiences. Here's a brief overview of the main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `stylesLandscape.css` and `stylesPortrait.css`: CSS files for landscape and portrait orientations.
- `landscape.js` and `portrait.js`: JavaScript files handling the specific functionalities for each orientation.

## Development and Design

Throughout this project, I have employed various web technologies and design principles:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including complex animations and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions and handling orientation-specific functionalities.

## Reflection

This project was much more than just a coding exercise; it was a journey into the depths of web development. It pushed me to explore and implement complex functionalities, deepening my understanding of web development principles.

## Future Directions

The insights gained from this project will guide my future endeavors. I plan to focus more on responsive design from the outset and develop a more streamlined approach to managing animations and site architecture.

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to Codecademy for providing the platform to learn and build such an extensive project. This project is a testament to the skills and knowledge I've gained through their Full Stack Engineer Career Path.
