# Ricardo Rocheta's Personal Website

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal website project! This site extends beyond the requirements of my second Codecademy off-platform project. Here's the template website I was instructed to emulate and personalize: [Template Website](https://priceless-kepler-06d70c.netlify.app/). My commitment to learning and applying web development skills is reflected in the complexity and depth of this project. Although it's not yet my GitHub Page due to partial functionality, I plan to build an improved portfolio/interactive CV after completing my Full-Stack Engineer course at Codecademy.

### Important Note:

For the optimal experience, please maintain the same screen orientation (portrait or landscape) throughout your visit. If you change the orientation, reload the website to ensure proper functionality.

## Project Insights

### Key Takeaways

This project has been an enlightening learning experience, offering several key insights:

- **Responsive Design**: Emphasized the importance of @media queries for varying screen sizes, proving more efficient than JavaScript for orientation checks.
- **Development Approach**: Found it beneficial to design page elements for different screen sizes during the development process, especially when incorporating animations.
- **Handling Animations**: Learned that while animations enhance aesthetics, they require careful management across screen sizes and orientations.
- **Architecture Over Flexibility**: Realized the challenges of creating two separate sites for each orientation and the need for a robust, single responsive site in future projects.

### Project Structure

The project is structured with distinct stylesheets and scripts for each orientation:

- `index.html`: The core HTML file.
- `stylesLandscape.css` and `stylesPortrait.css`: Orientation-specific CSS files.
- `landscape.js` and `portrait.js`: JavaScript files for respective orientation functionalities.

## Development and Design

The project employs a range of web technologies and design principles:

- **HTML5**: For content structuring.
- **CSS3**: For advanced styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: To enhance dynamic interactions and handle orientation-based features.
- **Git & GitHub**: Utilized for version control, code tracking, and backup.

## Reflection

This project was more than a coding task; it was a deep dive into web development, challenging me to integrate complex functionalities and solidify my understanding of core principles.

## Future Directions

Insights from this project will shape my future work. I aim to prioritize responsive design and streamline animation management and site architecture.

## Acknowledgments
